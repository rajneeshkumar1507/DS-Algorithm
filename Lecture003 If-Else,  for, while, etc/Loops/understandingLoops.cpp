/*
    Loops comes into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statement
    Mainly two types of loops
    1. Entry controlled loops: In this type of loop, the test condition is tested
    before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop is entry-controlled loops.

    2. Exit Controlled loops: Execute atleast once means condition is tested at the 
    end of the loop body.
